# Social Good Charity

## Synopsis

The charity impacts society significantly in areas including education, healthcare, hunger, drink-ing water, disaster relief, environmental preservation, and assistance for underserved people. The existing charity has numerous limitations, such as poor management, high operation costs, and lack of transparency in the donation execution flow. Authentication of users and institutions is a big problem of the existing system regarding actual appearance. In this research work, blockchain technology resolves the issue of transparency and reliability with the facility of an immutable and traceable distributed ledger for the transactions of charity funds. We have the originality to empower the existing centralized traditional charity works by blockchain tech-nology with the authentication approach, Know Your Customer (KYC), and cryptographic HASH. This proposed approach satisfies all the functionalities of the existing traditional charity framework. Personal information privacy is implemented using the filters at smart contracts. The modified implementation of KYC to ensure authenticity and make data flow securely through the channel from end users to the platform are two significant contributions of this work. A coin toss function for data selection for passing through the channel to make it tedious to attack and random time delay between data to avoid the guess for attack. We aim for this framework to send 100% of donations to the beneficiaries and become a hyper-liquid medium to fill up the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) funding gap. In this research, we also introduce the concept of service charity to broaden the types where people offer their services and skills as charity.
